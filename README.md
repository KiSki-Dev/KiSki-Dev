## Hi there üëã
### Im KiSki also Felix, im a young Developer from Germany!

üåÉ **My Big Dream is to get a Application Developer or Game Developer** in a great Company!
#### My Programming History:
- I started Programming when I was 12 years old, I learned **[Python](https://www.python.org/)** as my first Language. I made my first real Program, **[Auto Offline Client (Python)](https://github.com/KiSki-Dev/AutoOfflineClient)**.<br>
- Over the next years, I made smaller **[Python](https://www.python.org/)** Projects, learned to use **[Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux)**, played alot **[HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com/)** and I learned a bit of **[HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Markup_Language)**, **[JS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)** and **[CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets)**.<br>
- With 14 years old I learned **[C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp)**. My first good **[C#](hhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp)** Program was a **[GUI Version of AutoOffline](https://github.com/KiSki-Dev/AutoOffline)**. After finishing this, I made some smaller Programs/Projects.<br>
- A few Months later, I started learning **[Unity](https://unity.com/en)** to make my first professional Game! This Game is still in Production but I am planning to release it on **[Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/)**.<br>
- In 2023 I completed a two-week internship as an Application Developer at **‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà** as part of my school curriculum.
- In 2024 I completed another two-week internship as an Application Developer at **‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà** as part of my school curriculum.
